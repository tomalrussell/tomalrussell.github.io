This site is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses Jekyll to generate static HTML websites from text files (written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and some templates. 

Here's a quick rundown of what's required to set one of these up:

On a local machine:

* a text editor, for writing 
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), for version control, and to push to Github.
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), the language that Jekyll is written in / the interpreter that it runs on.
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby gem (installable module) that generates the site and can run locally to preview changes.

On the internet:

* a [Github](https://github.com/) user account, where the site will be hosted
* a domain name, if you want a non-github web address (I just used [123-Reg](https://www.123-reg.co.uk/), but there are plenty of options).

And finally, documentation:

* [Github Pages Help](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)
* [Jekyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
* [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)


That's a fair list of prerequisites. I thought about making this a full step-by-step, but I'm sure I'd miss out something crucial.

In outline: install Git, Ruby and Jekyll; run the Jekyll quick start; push to Github.
