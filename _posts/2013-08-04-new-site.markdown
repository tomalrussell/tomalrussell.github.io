Hello, nice of you to swing by. Things are just getting going, you haven't missed much at all. My name's Tom, pleased to meet you.

I've come up with three reasons for this website:

1. Trying stuff out 
1. Keeping track of things I might forget
1. Writing things up to understand and explain them.

For example:

1. I'm trying out using [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](//pages.github.com) to make and host this website.
1. I might forget the [Markdown](//daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax for links &ndash; `[link text](http://example.com)`.
1. This little list is my off-the-top-of-the-head manifesto, which I'd barely thought of before starting writing. 

Coming Soon to a Screen near you:

1. Better-than-default styling!
1. Bookmarks, links and snippets!
1. 
   * How-tos, reviews, articles! 
   * Letters (from a-z) in countless combinations! 
   * Numerals, whitespace and all manner of punctuation?!@#

That's all for now, hope to see you around.

/Tom
