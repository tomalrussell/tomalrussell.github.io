So instead of writing a blog post, I wrote a thing for starting off new blog
posts.

It's a python script to run from the command line. [Here's the gist.](https://gist.github.com/tomalrussell/0828db8491b99db032fe) It
takes the post title and any categories as arguments, sticks them together with
today's date to make a filename, and creates that file with the basic Jekyll
front matter in the current directory (or in the '_posts' directory if there is
one nested).
